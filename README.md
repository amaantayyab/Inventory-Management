# Inventory Management Dashboard

**Power BI Dashboard for Effective Inventory Control and Service Level Maintenance**

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive and visually appealing Power BI dashboard designed to efficiently manage inventory levels while maintaining optimal service levels. The dashboard provides deep insights into various inventory metrics, ensuring informed decision-making and precise inventory control.

## Key Features

- **ABC and XYZ Classifications**: Analyzed inventory using ABC and XYZ classifications to categorize items based on their consumption value and variability, facilitating targeted inventory management.
  
- **Sales Forecasting & Pareto Validation**: Forecasted future sales and validated the Pareto 80-20 rule, ensuring that inventory control focuses on the most impactful items.
  
- **Key Metrics Assessment**: Assessed critical metrics such as Inventory Turnover Ratio, Safety Stock levels, Reorder levels, Stock Status, and Weekly Demand, enabling real-time monitoring and control.

- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Leveraged advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI to present inventory data interactively, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp key insights and take action.

## Data Modeling & Backend Work

- **Data Import & Transformation**: Imported raw data into Power BI, performed data transformations, and ensured correct data types were assigned to each column for accurate analysis and visualization.

- **Backend Data Preparation**: Created and configured various columns and calculated fields in the backend to support the dashboard’s functionality, ensuring the data was structured optimally for analysis.
